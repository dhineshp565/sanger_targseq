# Usage: typing.sh <SampleName> <consensus_sequence> <abricate_database_directory>
# Arguments:
#   $1 - SampleName: The name of the sample being analyzed.
#   $2 - consensus_sequence: The path to the consensus sequence file.
#   $3 - abricate_database_directory: The directory containing the abricate database.
